# File_system_organizer
I have build a global command line appilcation using node.js
It organizes all your files from a folder into different section or categories(media, archives, document, app etc).
So that you need not to do it manually.

Steps for Running this project live in your folder
1. Clone the given repo 
2. Install the required dev dependencies by running npm install.
4. Then run "npm link" command in the project folder this will basically make the commands global 
5. If you run the command "pep help" in your pc globally in any folder then it will run
6. Similiarly "pep organize will" also run.
